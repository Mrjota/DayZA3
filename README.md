Created by The Zoombies Development Team and the DayZA3 Community

This is the main GitHub for the DayZ port to Arma 3.

Official Hive Hosting is HFB exclusive for the time being. We do not provide support for private hive servers.

======
During the development of the port, GSP server hosting is NOT allowed.

We are aware that the mod is opensource, but we only use it for the progress tracking. If this is abused (code being taken without permission, etc.) we will no longer have it on GitHub.

If you would like to use our code for another port please contact us for permission. If permission is given, you must include all of our credits in your port.

This pertains to the code WE wrote, not the DayZMod Development Team.
